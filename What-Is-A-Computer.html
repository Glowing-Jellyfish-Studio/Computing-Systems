        <h1>What is a Computer?</h1>
        <p>A <mark>computer</mark> stores, shares and analyzes huge amounts of data. It can also perform complex math cacluations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although a CD (compact disk) can store information like music, it's not concidered a computer because the CD itself can't change information</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Computers Through Time</h1>
        <p>Thousands of years ago, people made devices like the <mark>abacus</mark> to help them cacluate complex math.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the 1600s, computing became a profession and the word "computer" meant "a person who makes cacluations." Computers (the people) used a tool called the <mark>slide rule</mark> to help them cacluate.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1944, during the World War II, the first electronic computer was made. It was first called [COLOSSUS MARK 1] and was uded by the British goverment to crack secret German codes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1945, Americans created a faster computer called [ENIAC].</p>
        <br>
        <h3>ENIAC</h3>
        <p>Stands for"<u>E</u>lectronic <u>N</u>umerical <u>I</u>ntegrator <u>a</u>nd <u>C</u>omputer," which was the first programmable, general-purpose computer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Early computers were massive-they took up entire rooms! These computers were used by large buisnesses, goverments, or researchers./p>
        <br>
        <p>The first mass-produced personal computer, the [APPLE II], was introuced in 1977. Owners could use the computer to run simple programs or play games.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>They run programs (like messaging, photo editing, and maps).</li>
            <li>They store information (like photos, contact information and documents).</li>
            <li>They perform cacluations (with a cacluator, with the clock/stopwatch, with maps).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Smartphones are more powerful computers than the computer used on the rocket that took the astronauts to the moon in 1969.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Part Of A whole</h1>
        <p>Computers are made up of two parts: <mark>hardware</mark> and <mark>software</mark>.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Hardware</h3>
        <p>Hardware is the physical parts of a computer, like the keyboard, mouse, and screen. An easy way to determine whether part of a computer system is hardare is to look: If you can see it with your eyes, it's hardware.</p>
