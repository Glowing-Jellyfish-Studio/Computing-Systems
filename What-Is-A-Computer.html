        <h1>What is a Computer?</h1>
        <p>A <mark>computer</mark> stores, shares and analyzes huge amounts of data. It can also perform complex math cacluations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although a CD (compact disk) can store information like music, it's not concidered a computer because the CD itself can't change information</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Computers Through Time</h1>
        <p>Thousands of years ago, people made devices like the <mark>abacus</mark> to help them cacluate complex math.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the 1600s, computing became a profession and the word "computer" meant "a person who makes cacluations." Computers (the people) used a tool called the <mark>slide rule</mark> to help them cacluate.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1944, during the World War II, the first electronic computer was made. It was first called [COLOSSUS MARK 1] and was uded by the British goverment to crack secret German codes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1945, Americans created a faster computer called [ENIAC].</p>
        <br>
        <h3>ENIAC</h3>
        <p>Stands for"<u>E</u>lectronic <u>N</u>umerical <u>I</u>ntegrator <u>a</u>nd <u>C</u>omputer," which was the first programmable, general-purpose computer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Early computers were massive-they took up entire rooms! These computers were used by large buisnesses, goverments, or researchers./p>
        <br>
        <p>The first mass-produced personal computer, the [APPLE II], was introuced in 1977. Owners could use the computer to run simple programs or play games.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>They run programs (like messaging, photo editing, and maps).</li>
            <li>They store information (like photos, contact information and documents).</li>
            <li>They perform cacluations (with a cacluator, with the clock/stopwatch, with maps).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Smartphones are more powerful computers than the computer used on the rocket that took the astronauts to the moon in 1969.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Part Of A whole</h1>
        <p>Computers are made up of two parts: <mark>hardware</mark> and <mark>software</mark>.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>Hardware is the physical parts of a computer, like the keyboard, mouse, and screen. An easy way to determine whether part of a computer system is hardare is to look: If you can see it with your eyes, it's hardware.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>Software is the set of programs (instructions) that tell a computer what to do, like phone applications, editing programs, and entertainmenr services. There aew all kinds of software: from games for a gaming system, to the program that runs on your microwave, to the web browser on your phone. Software is stored on storage devices (hardware) like hard drives, flash drives, and CDs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>An <b>application</b> (app) is a program designed for the user to perform a task-like a photo.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All applicaions are programs, but not all programs are applications. Some programs are for computer's use only-not the person using the computer.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Take A Closer Look At Hardware</h1>
        <p>Hardware can be seperated into different categories.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>Input refers to the parts used to send information to a computer, including a keyboard, mouse, game controller, and webcam.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Storage</h2>
        Storage refers to the parts that the computer uses to store information, including hard drives, <mark>USB flash drives</mark>, CDs, and <mark>RAM</mark>.
        <br>
        <h3>USB (universal serial bus) Flash Drive</h3>
        <p>Also known as a thumb drive or a USB stick; a portable plug-in device used to store information.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>RAM (random access memory)</h3>
        <p>A type of computer memory where information can be stored.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Processing</h2>
        <p>The processing parts of the computer run programs, interpret input, and supply output, icluding the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU).</p>
