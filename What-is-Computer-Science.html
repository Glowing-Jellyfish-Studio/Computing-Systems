        <h1>What is Computer Science?</h1>
        <p>A <mark>computer</mark> is a device that stores and processes (changes, moves, or rewrites) information. It can perform complicated computations and organise and store huge amounts of information. Computer science is the study of technology can be used to solve problems. It involves studying <mark>computing systems</mark>, programming rules, data and analysis, networking, the internet, and how computers affect out lives. Computers are better than humams at storing and sharing tons of information, solving complex cacluations quickly, and learnin things. <span class="underline">Computer scientists use computers' abilities to help them to develop new technologies that make our lives easier.</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>Computer technology affects the way we live and think. It can help us solve our problems and make our lives seem easier, more fun, and safer.</p>
        <h2>For example</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Computers helped navigate spacecraft to the moon and Mars.</li>
            <li>Robots help surgeons perform surgeries with great precision.</li>
            <li>Computers add realistic visual sand sound effects to movies and video games.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Computer scientists use and create technology to solve problems. They program computers to both complete tasks better and faster as well as teach them how to do new things. Becoming a computer scientist means shifting from being only a <b>consumer</b> (someone who uses something) to being a <b>creator</b>.</b></p>
        <p>Computer science is a type of problem solving; it includes the study of computers, their design, and the way they process information.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Examples of what computer science IS:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating a phone app (application or program) that allows friends to share funny cat videos to each other.</li>
            <li>Programming your own video game.</li>
            <li>Writing a program that cacluates the answers to the maths problems in your homework.</li>
            <li>Writing a program to automacially post nice comments on your friends' pictures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of what computer science IS NOT:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Watching videos on the internet of cats riding tricycles.</li>
            <li>Playing your favourite video game.</li>
            <li>Doing your maths homework on your school's laptop.</li>
            <li>Commenting on the latest picture your friend posted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All the examples in the <b>IS NOT</b> list only use technology, while the examples in the <b>IS</b> list create new technology.</p>
