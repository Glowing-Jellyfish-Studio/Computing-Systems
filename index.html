        <h1>What is Computer Science?</h1>
        <p>A <mark>computer</mark> is a device that stores and processes (changes, moves, or rewrites) information. It can perform complicated computations and organise and store huge amounts of information. Computer science is the study of technology can be used to solve problems. It involves studying <mark>computing systems</mark>, programming rules, data and analysis, networking, the internet, and how computers affect out lives. Computers are better than humams at storing and sharing tons of information, solving complex cacluations quickly, and learnin things. <span class="underline">Computer scientists use computers' abilities to help them to develop new technologies that make our lives easier.</span>
